Phase 3: Build Training Dataset with Real Player Features

Purpose: Combine player database + high-quality matches â†’ Training CSV
Strategy: Calculate REAL team features from actual player career statistics
Output: Training dataset ready for Random Forest & XGBoost

This is where the magic happens - player impact becomes measurable!

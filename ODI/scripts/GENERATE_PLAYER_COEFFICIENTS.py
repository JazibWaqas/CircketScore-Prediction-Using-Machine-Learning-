GENERATE PLAYER IMPACT COEFFICIENTS

Calculates player impact coefficients from actual career statistics.
Data-driven, not hardcoded!

Formula:
- Batting impact: Based on batting avg vs ODI average (32), strike rate, experience
- Bowling impact: Based on economy vs ODI average (5.2), wicket-taking ability

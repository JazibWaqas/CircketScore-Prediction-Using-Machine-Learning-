PLAYER IMPACT VALIDATION RESULTS
=================================

TEST 1: ELITE VS AVERAGE PLAYER
❌ Elite Batsman Impact: 0.00 runs (Target: 25-40 runs)
  - Tested: 0 scenarios
  - Correlation: 0.0000
  - Direction: Incorrect

TEST 2: STAR PLAYER COMPARISONS
⚠ Star Player Differentiation: 1.0 runs range (Target: 8-15 runs)
  - Players compared: 4
  - Model distinguishes between star players: Partially

TEST 3: ELITE BOWLER IMPACT
❌ Elite Bowler Impact: -0.68 runs (Target: 15-25 runs)
  - Tested: 40 scenarios
  - Effect: None/Negative

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
===================
Player Impact Detection: WEAK
Feature Effectiveness: LOW

The model UNSUCCESSFULLY demonstrates player-level impact in predictions.
Individual player features account for ~16% of model importance.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================
❌ Player impact features are not effective enough. Need to:
   - Redesign player feature engineering
   - Add more granular player statistics
   - Consider using baseline model (R²=0.69) which performed better
   - The enhanced features may be adding noise rather than signal

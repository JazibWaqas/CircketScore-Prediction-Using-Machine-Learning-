ODI SCORE PREDICTION - REAL MATCH VALIDATION
================================================================================

Model: CLEAN_xgboost.pkl (No data leakage)
Test period: 2023-02-28 to 2025-09-07
Total matches: 350

OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
  MAE: 54.7 runs
  Within ±30: 242/700 (34.6%)

MAJOR TEAMS (304 matches):
  MAE: 54.6 runs
  Within ±30: 33.2%

KEY FINDINGS:
  ✓ Model works best on average scores (200-250 runs)
  ✗ Underpredicts high scores (300+) by 50-80 runs
  ✗ Overpredicts collapses (<150) by 80-110 runs
  ✓ No systematic bias (error = +0.2 runs)

CONCLUSION:
  Model provides reasonable baseline estimates but struggles with extremes.
  Without pitch conditions, R²=0.18 is realistic performance ceiling.

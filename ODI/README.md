# 🏏 ODI Cricket Score Prediction - PROJECT STATUS

**Last Updated:** October 10, 2024, 12:15 AM  
**Status:** 🔧 **Model Broken - Frontend/API Working**

---

## 🚨 **CURRENT STATUS**

### ✅ **What Works**
- **Frontend (React):** Dual T20/ODI toggle, player selection with filters, beautiful UI
- **ODI API (Flask):** Running on port 5001, all endpoints functional
- **Player Database:** 1,872 players (977 with career stats and impact coefficients)
- **Data:** 7,314 ODI matches, 378 venues, 22 teams

### ❌ **What's Broken**
- **Prediction Model:** Claims R²=0.69 but actually R²=0.01
- **Symptoms:** Predicts ~235 runs every time, no variation
- **Cause:** Training/test feature mismatch + model underfitting

### 🎯 **What's Needed**
- **Action:** Rebuild model with clean features
- **Time:** 6-8 hours
- **Target:** R² > 0.70, MAE < 28 runs

---

## 📊 **THE PROBLEM (Verified by Testing)**

```
CLAIMED (saved in model):     ACTUAL (tested on 500 matches):
R² = 0.69 (69%)              R² = 0.01 (1%)
MAE = 28.67 runs             MAE = 56.5 runs
```

**Test Results:**
- Australia vs India (350 runs actual) → 200 predicted (error: -150 runs)
- New Zealand vs Pakistan (275 actual) → 200 predicted (error: -75 runs)
- Only 31% predictions within ±30 runs (need 70%+)

**Root Cause:**
1. Test data missing 8 critical features: `team_encoded`, `venue_encoded`, `toss_decision_bat`, etc.
2. Model was never properly validated after training
3. Predictions cluster around dataset mean (235 runs) with std=20.8 (should be 70+)

## 🔧 **HOW TO FIX (Rebuild Approach)**

### **Step 1: Build Simple Dataset (2-3 hours)**
Create dataset with 15-20 proven features:
```python
# Team strength features
- team_batting_avg_last_10
- team_bowling_avg_last_10  
- opp_batting_avg_last_10
- opp_bowling_avg_last_10

# Match context
- venue_avg_score
- venue_matches
- toss_won
- toss_decision_bat
- season_month
- match_number

# Recent form
- team_recent_form (last 5)
- opp_recent_form
- h2h_avg_runs
- h2h_win_rate
```

### **Step 2: Train Properly (2 hours)**
```python
# Conservative hyperparameters to avoid overfitting:
xgb_params = {
    'n_estimators': 200,
    'max_depth': 5,
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'min_child_weight': 10,
    'subsample': 0.8,
    'colsample_bytree': 0.8
}

# Temporal split - last 500 matches as test
train = df[:-500]
test = df[-500:]

# MUST: Ensure test has SAME features as train!
```

### **Step 3: Actually Test (1 hour)**
```python
# Test on held-out data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate metrics
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)

# VERIFY before celebrating:
if r2 < 0.65: iterate on features/hyperparameters
if mae > 35: check for systematic bias
```

### **Step 4: Validate with Real Matches (30 min)**
Use `VERIFY_MODEL_ACCURACY.py` to test on real historical matches

### **Step 5: Update API (30 min)**
Replace broken model files with new ones

## 🎯 **TARGET PERFORMANCE**

```
Minimum:      R² > 0.60, MAE < 35
Good:         R² > 0.70, MAE < 28  ⭐ TARGET
Excellent:    R² > 0.75, MAE < 25
```

ODI is more predictable than T20, so R² > 0.70 is achievable.

---

## 🚀 **QUICK COMMANDS**

### **Test Current (Broken) Model:**
```bash
python TEST_MODEL_WITH_REAL_FEATURES.py
# Shows: R²=0.01, MAE=56.5
```

### **Start Systems:**
```bash
cd T20/Database && python run_final.py &           # Port 5000 (working)
cd ODI/Database && python run_odi_api_COMPLETE.py & # Port 5001 (broken model)
cd frontend && npm start &                          # Port 3000
```

### **Test Frontend:**
```
http://localhost:3000
→ Toggle to ODI
→ Select teams, add players
→ Make prediction (will be wrong ~235 runs)
```

## 📚 **KEY LEARNINGS**

1. **Always verify saved metrics** - R²=0.69 was never tested, actually 0.01
2. **Feature mismatch is fatal** - Train/test must have identical features
3. **Simple > Complex** - 15 good features > 67 questionable ones
4. **Test early** - Would have caught this on day 1
5. **Player impact as overlay works** - Keep it separate from base model

## 🗂️ **DATA SOURCES**

```
raw_data/odis_ballbyBall/        - 5,761 match JSON files (ball-by-ball)
raw_data/odi_data/               - detailed_player_data.csv (1,872 players)
```

These generate:
```
→ CURRENT_training_data_7314_matches.csv
→ CURRENT_player_database_977_quality.json
→ CURRENT_player_impacts_1872_all.json
```

## 📞 **FOR TOMORROW**

1. **Decide:** Rebuild (recommended) or Fix
2. **If rebuilding:** Follow 5-step plan above
3. **Test thoroughly** before claiming success
4. **Expected:** 1 day work, R² > 0.70 achievable

---

**Bottom Line:** Frontend perfect ✓, API working ✓, just need working model (6-8 hours) 🔧

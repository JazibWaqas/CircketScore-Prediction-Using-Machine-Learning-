# 🏏 ODI Cricket Score Prediction - PROJECT STATUS

**Last Updated:** October 10, 2024, 12:15 AM  
**Status:** 🔧 **Model Broken - Frontend/API Working**

---

## 🚨 **CURRENT STATUS**

### ✅ **What Works**
- **Frontend (React):** Dual T20/ODI toggle, player selection with filters, beautiful UI
- **APIs (Flask):** Both T20 (port 5000) and ODI (port 5001) endpoints functional
- **Player Database:** 1,872 players (977 with career stats and impact coefficients)
- **Data:** 7,314 ODI matches, 378 venues, 22 teams

### ❌ **BOTH MODELS BROKEN!**
- **ODI Model:** Claims R²=0.69 but actually R²=0.01 (predicts ~235 runs every time)
- **T20 Model:** Claims R²=0.70 but actually R²=-0.05 (predicts ~144 runs every time)
- **Symptoms:** No variation in predictions (std=1.0 vs actual std=45+)
- **ROOT CAUSE:** **DATA LEAKAGE** in training datasets (pitch_bounce/pitch_swing features)

### 🎯 **What's Needed**
- **Action:** Rebuild BOTH T20 and ODI models with clean features
- **Time:** 8-12 hours (both formats)
- **Target ODI:** R² > 0.70, MAE < 28 runs
- **Target T20:** R² > 0.60, MAE < 15 runs (T20 is more unpredictable)

---

## 📊 **THE PROBLEM (Verified by Testing)**

### **ODI Model:**
```
CLAIMED:     R² = 0.69, MAE = 28.67
ACTUAL:      R² = 0.01, MAE = 56.5
```
- Predicts ~235 runs every time (std=20.8, should be 70+)
- Australia vs India 350 actual → 200 predicted (error: -150!)
- Only 31% within ±30 runs

### **T20 Model:**
```
CLAIMED:     R² = 0.70, MAE = ~15
ACTUAL:      R² = -0.05, MAE = 37.9
```
- Predicts ~144 runs every time (std=1.0, should be 45+)
- West Indies 214 actual → 145 predicted (error: -69)
- Only 31% within ±20 runs

---

## 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE: DATA LEAKAGE DISCOVERED**

### **The Smoking Gun:**
```python
Feature: pitch_bounce
Correlation with score: 0.556 (HIGHEST in entire dataset!)
Values: 0.75 - 2.0 (varies by match)

Problem: You can ONLY measure pitch bounce DURING/AFTER the match!
         Cannot know it BEFORE predicting!
```

### **What Happened:**

**During Training:**
```
Model learned: "High pitch_bounce = high scores" (correlation 0.556)
Training R² = 0.69 (model thinks it's smart!)
```

**During Real Prediction:**
```
You: "Predict Australia vs Pakistan tomorrow"
Model: "What's pitch_bounce?"
You: "Match hasn't happened yet, I don't know!"
Model: *defaults to 1.0*
Prediction fails → R² = 0.01
```

**This is CLASSIC data leakage** - using information available only AFTER match to predict it!

### **Other Leaked Features:**
- `pitch_swing` (0.361 correlation) - Measured during match
- `humidity`, `temperature` - If actual measurements, not pre-match estimates

**Model got good training scores by "cheating" with future information!**

---

## ✅ **GOOD NEWS: RAW DATA IS EXCELLENT**

### **Your CricInfo Data Contains (verified):**

**Ball-by-Ball JSON (5,761 ODI matches):**
```json
{
  "info": {
    "teams": ["Australia", "Pakistan"],
    "venue": "Brisbane Cricket Ground",
    "players": {"Australia": [11 players], "Pakistan": [11 players]},
    "toss": {"winner": "Australia", "decision": "bat"},
    "dates": ["2017-01-13"]
  },
  "innings": [ball-by-ball data → final score]
}
```

**Player Stats CSV (52,031 player-match records):**
```
Player: RG Sharma, Runs: 264, Balls: 176, SR: 150
Opposition, Venue, Wickets taken, etc.
```

**This data is PREMIUM quality!** Most papers use 500-1000 matches. You have 13,000!

### **What You CAN Extract (No Leakage):**
```
✓ Team names, opposition
✓ Venue (can get historical averages)
✓ Date (season effects)
✓ Toss winner and decision
✓ Actual 11 players selected
✓ Player career stats (from CSV)
✓ Team recent form (from past matches)
✓ Head-to-head history
✓ Final scores (target)
```

## 🎯 **THE REAL ISSUE: DATASETS WERE BUILT WRONG**

### **Current Dataset Problems:**

**1. Includes Post-Match Information (Data Leakage):**
```
pitch_bounce: 0.75-2.0    ← Can only measure DURING match
pitch_swing: 0.3-1.5      ← Can only measure DURING match
```

**2. 8 Categorical Features Not Properly Encoded:**
```
venue: 378 unique values  ← Should be: venue_avg_score (numeric)
team: 64 unique values    ← Should be: team_recent_avg (numeric)
date: 2364 unique values  ← Should be: month/year (numeric)
```

**3. Missing from Test Data:**
```
team_encoded, venue_encoded, opposition_encoded
toss_decision_bat, team_team_batting_avg
```

**The dataset builder scripts had fundamental flaws!**

## 🔧 **HOW TO FIX (Rebuild Datasets WITHOUT Leakage)**

### **Step 1: Build Clean Dataset (2-3 hours)**

**Process Ball-by-Ball JSON:**
```python
for match_file in raw_data/odis_ballbyBall/*.json:
    1. Extract match info: teams, venue, date, toss
    2. Get player lists (11 per team)
    3. Calculate final score (target)
    4. NO pitch_bounce, NO pitch_swing (can't know beforehand!)
```

**Add Historical Features (calculable before match):**
```python
# Venue features (from past matches at this venue)
- venue_avg_score              ← Historical average
- venue_matches                ← Sample size

# Team features (from player CSV + past matches)
- team_avg_batting_avg         ← Average of 11 players' career avg
- team_avg_bowling_avg         ← Average of bowlers' career avg
- team_recent_avg              ← Last 5 match scores
- team_form_trend              ← Improving or declining?

# Opposition features (same as above)
- opp_avg_batting_avg
- opp_avg_bowling_avg
- opp_recent_avg

# Match context
- toss_won (0/1)
- batting_first (0/1)
- season_month (1-12)
- h2h_avg_runs                 ← Historical head-to-head
- h2h_win_rate

Total: ~15-18 features, ALL knowable before match!
```

**Critical Rules:**
```
✅ ONLY use information available BEFORE match starts
✅ Venue stats from PAST matches only (not including current)
✅ Team form from PAST matches only
❌ NO pitch conditions measured during match
❌ NO weather measured during match
❌ NO outcome-related features
```

### **Step 2: Train XGBoost (2 hours)**
```python
# Split data temporally
train = df[:-500]  # Older matches
test = df[-500:]   # Most recent 500 matches

# Ensure EXACT same features
assert all(f in test.columns for f in train.columns)

# Train with conservative hyperparameters
xgb_params = {
    'n_estimators': 300,
    'max_depth': 6,
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'min_child_weight': 5,
    'subsample': 0.8,
    'colsample_bytree': 0.8,
    'random_state': 42
}

model = XGBRegressor(**xgb_params)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

### **Step 3: Test & Validate (1 hour)**
```python
# Predict on held-out test data
predictions = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Calculate actual metrics
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)

# Verify predictions actually vary
pred_std = predictions.std()
actual_std = y_test.std()

print(f"R²: {r2:.3f}")
print(f"MAE: {mae:.1f}")
print(f"Pred std: {pred_std:.1f} (should be close to {actual_std:.1f})")

# CRITICAL: Check variation
if pred_std < 20:
    print("ERROR: Predictions don't vary! Model not learning!")
    # Iterate on features
```

### **Step 4: Validate with Real Matches (30 min)**
Use `VERIFY_MODEL_ACCURACY.py` to test on real historical matches

### **Step 5: Update API (30 min)**
Replace broken model files with new ones

## 🎯 **REALISTIC PERFORMANCE (Without Leaked Features)**

### **Previous Results Had Data Leakage:**
```
With pitch_bounce (LEAKED):   R² = 0.69 (training), R² = 0.01 (real use)
```

### **Expected Results WITHOUT Leakage:**

**ODI (More Predictable):**
```
Conservative:  R² = 0.45-0.55, MAE = 28-35 runs
Good:          R² = 0.55-0.65, MAE = 24-28 runs  ⭐ REALISTIC TARGET
Excellent:     R² = 0.65-0.72, MAE = 20-24 runs  (if feature engineering perfect)
```

**T20 (Inherently Random):**
```
Conservative:  R² = 0.35-0.45, MAE = 15-18 runs
Good:          R² = 0.45-0.55, MAE = 12-15 runs  ⭐ REALISTIC TARGET
Excellent:     R² = 0.55-0.62, MAE = 10-12 runs  (very hard, T20 is chaotic)
```

**Why Lower?**
- Without pitch info, we lose the strongest predictor (correlation 0.556)
- But predictions will actually WORK in real use!
- R² = 0.55 with honest features > R² = 0.69 with leaked features

**Academic Papers (Without Pitch Info):**
- Typical ODI: R² = 0.50-0.65
- Typical T20: R² = 0.40-0.55

**Your targets are ACHIEVABLE and PUBLISHABLE!**

## 🚀 **QUICK COMMANDS**

### **Test Current (Broken) Models:**
```bash
python TEST_T20_MODEL.py                  # T20: R²=-0.05, predicts ~144 runs
python TEST_MODEL_WITH_REAL_FEATURES.py  # ODI: R²=0.01, predicts ~235 runs
```

### **Start Systems:**
```bash
cd T20/Database && python run_final.py &           # Port 5000 (broken model)
cd ODI/Database && python run_odi_api_COMPLETE.py & # Port 5001 (broken model)
cd frontend && npm start &                          # Port 3000
```

### **Test Frontend:**
```
http://localhost:3000
→ Works beautifully (UI is perfect!)
→ Predictions will be wrong (models broken)
→ T20: ~144 runs every time
→ ODI: ~235 runs every time
```

## 📚 **KEY LEARNINGS**

1. **Data leakage destroys real-world performance** - pitch_bounce gave R²=0.69 in training but R²=0.01 in real use
2. **Always verify saved metrics** - Both models claimed success but failed on test data
3. **Feature mismatch is fatal** - Train/test must have identical features
4. **Only use pre-match information** - If you can't know it before match starts, don't include it
5. **Variation matters** - If predictions don't vary (std<5), model isn't learning
6. **Simple > Complex** - 15 honest features > 67 with leakage
7. **Test early and actually** - Would have caught this on day 1
8. **Player impact as overlay works** - Keep it separate from base model

## 📝 **SUMMARY FOR TOMORROW**

### **What We Discovered:**
1. ✓ **Raw data is EXCELLENT** - 13,000 matches from CricInfo, ball-by-ball
2. ✗ **Datasets were built WRONG** - included pitch_bounce (data leakage)
3. ✗ **Both T20 and ODI models are BROKEN** - R² near zero in real use
4. ✓ **Frontend and APIs are PERFECT** - no issues there
5. ✓ **Player impact system WORKS** - can keep as overlay

### **Why Models Seemed Good:**
- Training data included `pitch_bounce` (correlation 0.556 - strongest predictor)
- Model learned: "high bounce = high scores" (true!)
- **But you can't know bounce before the match!**
- In real use, defaults to 1.0 → model has no predictive power

### **What To Do:**
1. **Rebuild datasets** from raw JSON WITHOUT pitch/weather features
2. **Use only pre-match features:** team stats, venue history, form, toss
3. **Train properly** with clean data
4. **Test thoroughly** before celebrating
5. **Expected: R² = 0.50-0.65** (realistic without pitch info)

### **Timeline:**
- Build clean ODI dataset: 2-3 hours
- Train & test: 2 hours
- Build clean T20 dataset: 2-3 hours
- Train & test: 2 hours
- **Total: 8-12 hours for BOTH working systems**

### **Is It Doable?**
**YES!** 
- Raw data is excellent ✓
- You have more data than academic papers ✓
- Infrastructure is perfect ✓
- Just need clean feature engineering ✓
- R² = 0.55 is achievable and publishable ✓

**The hard part (frontend, infrastructure) is DONE. The easy part (proper dataset) remains!** 🎯

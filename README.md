# 🏏 Cricket Score Prediction with Player Impact

**Machine learning system for ODI/T20 cricket score prediction with player impact analysis**

---

## 🚨 **CURRENT STATUS**

### ✅ **Working**
- **Frontend:** Beautiful React UI with T20/ODI toggle, player search/filters ✓
- **APIs:** Both T20 and ODI endpoints functional ✓
- **Player Database:** 1,872 players with impact coefficients ✓

### ❌ **BOTH MODELS BROKEN!**
- **ODI Model:** R²=0.01 (claimed 0.69) - predicts ~235 runs every time
- **T20 Model:** R²=-0.05 (claimed 0.70) - predicts ~144 runs every time
- **ROOT CAUSE:** **DATA LEAKAGE** - datasets include `pitch_bounce`/`pitch_swing` (can only measure AFTER match)
- **Fix:** Rebuild datasets WITHOUT leaked features, retrain models (8-12 hours)

### 🎯 **The Discovery:**
- ✓ **Raw data is excellent:** 13,000 matches from CricInfo (ball-by-ball)
- ✗ **Datasets include data leakage:** `pitch_bounce` (correlation 0.556) can only be measured DURING match
- ✗ **Model learned to rely on leaked features:** Works in training (R²=0.69), fails in real use (R²=0.01)
- ✓ **Solution is simple:** Rebuild datasets with only pre-match features (team stats, venue history, form, toss)
- ✓ **Expected realistic performance:** R² = 0.50-0.65 (ODI), R² = 0.45-0.55 (T20) - both PUBLISHABLE!

## 📊 **FILE NAMING CONVENTION**

```
CURRENT_*     = Currently being used (may be broken but active)
BROKEN_*      = Known to be broken
REFERENCE_*   = Historical reference only
  ├─ FAILED_* = Failed experiments
  └─ OLD_*    = Previous approaches
```

**Examples:**
- `ODI/models/CURRENT_BROKEN_baseline_xgboost.pkl` - Model API uses (R²=0.01)
- `ODI/data/CURRENT_training_data_7314_matches.csv` - Main dataset (working)
- `ODI/data/BROKEN_test_data_missing_8_features.csv` - Test set with issues
- `ODI/models/REFERENCE_FAILED_enhanced_xgboost.pkl` - Failed 127-feature attempt

---

## 🚀 **QUICK START**

### **Run Everything:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: T20 API (working)
cd T20/Database && python run_final.py

# Terminal 2: ODI API (broken model but API works)
cd ODI/Database && python run_odi_api_COMPLETE.py

# Terminal 3: Frontend
cd frontend && npm start

# Open: http://localhost:3000
```

### **Test ODI Model (See It's Broken):**
```bash
python TEST_MODEL_WITH_REAL_FEATURES.py
# Output: R²=0.01, MAE=56.5, predictions cluster ~235 runs
```

## 🔧 **HOW TO FIX (Rebuild Both Models)**

### **Recommended: Rebuild from Scratch**

**Why:** Both models have same fundamental issues  
**Time:** 8-12 hours (can do T20 first as simpler)  
**Steps:**

1. **Build Simple Dataset** (2-3 hours)
   - Use 15-20 proven features (team averages, venue stats, form, toss)
   - Ensure train/test have IDENTICAL features
   - Temporal split (last 500 matches = test)

2. **Train XGBoost** (2 hours)
   - Conservative hyperparameters (avoid overfitting)
   - Cross-validation during training
   - Save: model, scaler, feature names

3. **Actually Test** (1 hour)
   - Test on held-out 500 matches
   - Verify R² > 0.65, MAE < 35
   - If not, iterate on features

4. **Validate** (30 min)
   - Test with real historical matches
   - Verify predictions make sense

5. **Deploy** (30 min)
   - Replace CURRENT_BROKEN_* files
   - Test via API and frontend

**Target:** R² > 0.70, MAE < 28, 65%+ within ±30 runs

## 📦 **WHAT WE HAVE**

### **Data (All in `ODI/data/`):**
- `CURRENT_training_data_7314_matches.csv` - 7,314 ODI matches, 71 features
- `CURRENT_player_database_977_quality.json` - 977 players with career stats
- `CURRENT_player_impacts_1872_all.json` - Impact coefficients for all 1,872 players
- Lookup tables for teams, venues, players

### **Models (All in `ODI/models/`):**
- `CURRENT_BROKEN_*` - Being used but broken (R²=0.01)
- `REFERENCE_FAILED_*` - Enhanced model attempt (R²=0.52, worse)
- `REFERENCE_OLD_*` - T20-style approach

### **Scripts (11 essential in `ODI/scripts/`):**
- `1_build_player_database.py` - Generated player DB
- `BUILD_COMPLETE_DATASET.py` - Generated training data
- `TRAIN_COMPLETE.py` - Training reference
- `GENERATE_PLAYER_COEFFICIENTS.py` - Generated impact scores

### **Testing:**
- `TEST_MODEL_WITH_REAL_FEATURES.py` - Tests model on held-out data
- `VERIFY_MODEL_ACCURACY.py` - Tests via API with real matches
- `get_real_match.py` - Gets historical match details

---

## 🎨 **FRONTEND FEATURES**

- **Format Toggle:** Switch between T20 and ODI
- **Player Selection:** 
  - Search by name, country, role
  - Filters: Country (all), Role, Quality Tier
  - Dropdown stays open when adding
  - Shows impact scores next to names
- **Match Context:** Venue, toss, tournament, pitch, weather
- **Results:** Shows both team scores, predicted winner, player breakdowns

---

## 🔑 **KEY LESSONS**

1. **Never trust saved metrics** - Always test on held-out data yourself
2. **Feature engineering matters** - 15 good features > 67 questionable ones
3. **Validate early** - Test before building entire system on top
4. **Simple works** - Complexity often makes things worse
5. **Keep player impact separate** - Works well as overlay on base prediction

## 📝 **FOR TOMORROW**

1. **Read this README** (5 min overview)
2. **Read `ODI/README.md`** (10 min full details & rebuild plan)
3. **Run tests** to verify: `python TEST_T20_MODEL.py` & `python TEST_MODEL_WITH_REAL_FEATURES.py`
4. **Rebuild datasets** from raw JSON (no pitch features) - 4-6 hours
5. **Train both models** properly - 3-4 hours
6. **Test thoroughly** before celebrating!

### **Bottom Line:**
```
✓ Raw data: EXCELLENT (13,000 matches from CricInfo)
✓ Frontend: PERFECT (beautiful UI, dual format)
✓ APIs: PERFECT (all endpoints working)
✓ Infrastructure: PERFECT (player system, databases)
✗ Datasets: BAD (data leakage - pitch_bounce)
✗ Models: BROKEN (learned from leaked data)

Fix: Rebuild datasets with clean features (8-12 hours)
Expected: R² = 0.50-0.65 (realistic and publishable!)
Doable: YES! 100% achievable in 1-2 days
```

**Your project is NOT too big. You're NOT in over your head. You just need clean datasets!** 💪

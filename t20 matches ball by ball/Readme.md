How can I help?
Spotting errors in the data
The first method of helping would be to spot any errors in the data. Ideally we won’t have any but there’s always the chance and if we can spot the errors we can fix them and write further validation to ensure that further examples don’t slip through.

Helping with missing data
The second method of helping is to help us get ball-by-ball data for our missing games. This doesn’t even have to involve finding the data, it’s possible you know a contact who may be able to shed light on some matches, or you know of someone who has the commentary for a match on tape. Even small bits of info might be enough to put us on the right track.

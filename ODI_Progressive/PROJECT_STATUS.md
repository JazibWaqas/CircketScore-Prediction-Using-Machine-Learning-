**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Backend Complete - Frontend Integration Next

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### Primary Goal
Build a progressive ODI score predictor that works at any match stage (pre-match to late-match) with team composition features for fantasy cricket analysis.

### Key Deliverables
1. ✅ Dataset with team aggregates (batting, bowling, venue)
2. ✅ Trained ML model (XGBoost)
3. ✅ Validation on 500+ real international ODI matches
4. ✅ Fantasy cricket features (what-if scenarios)
5. ❌ Frontend UI (pending)

---

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. Dataset Creation ✅

**File:** `scripts/1_build_dataset_full_features.py`

**What was built:**
- Parsed 5,761 ODI ball-by-ball JSON files
- Extracted 15 features + 1 categorical
- Calculated team aggregates (batting/bowling stats from 11 players)
- Computed venue historical averages (516 venues)
- Sampled at 5 checkpoints per match (ball 1, 60, 120, 180, 240)

**Output:**
- 12,254 training samples from 2,553 matches
- 90/10 train/test split (11,032 train / 1,222 test)
- Files: `data/progressive_full_features_dataset.csv`, train, test

**Status:** ✅ Complete and validated

---

### 2. Model Training ✅

**File:** `scripts/2_train_model_full_features.py`

**Model Specification:**
```
Pipeline:
  ColumnTransformer
  ├── Numeric (15 features) → StandardScaler
  └── Categorical (venue) → OneHotEncoder
                ↓
          XGBRegressor
          ├── n_estimators: 400
          ├── max_depth: 7
          ├── learning_rate: 0.1
          └── random_state: 42
```

**Training Results:**
- Training time: ~2-3 minutes
- Training samples: 11,032
- Test samples: 1,222

**Performance on test set:**
- R² = 0.532 (includes domestic matches)
- MAE = 36.40 runs

**Saved Files:**
- `models/progressive_model_full_features.pkl` - Trained pipeline
- `models/feature_names.json` - Feature metadata
- `models/training_metadata.json` - Training metrics

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### 3. Validation on Real Matches ✅

**File:** `tests/validate_real_international_matches.py`

**Validation Approach:**
- Filtered for INTERNATIONAL ODI matches only (not domestic)
- Tested model on 592 international matches
- Generated 2,904 predictions (5 checkpoints per match)

**Results:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **R² Score** | **0.692** |
| **MAE** | **24.93 runs** |
| **Accuracy (±30)** | **70.1%** |
| **Test cases** | **2,904** |

**Progressive Performance:**
- Pre-match: R² = 0.346, MAE = 41 runs
- Early (over 10): R² = 0.620, MAE = 29 runs
- Mid (over 20): R² = 0.746, MAE = 24 runs
- Late (over 30): R² = 0.857, MAE = 18 runs
- **Death (over 40): R² = 0.935, MAE = 12 runs**

**Saved Files:**
- `results/international_validation_results.csv` - All predictions
- `results/international_validation_summary.txt` - Summary metrics

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Validated on 2,904 real cases

---

### 4. Fantasy Feature Testing ✅

**File:** `tests/test_fantasy_scenarios.py`

**Tests Conducted:**

**A. What-If Player Swaps**
- Scenario: India at 180/3 after 30 overs
- Tested: Replacing batsmen with different skill levels
- Result: 1-3 run impact (model prioritizes match state over individual players)

**B. Team Composition Impact**
- Tested: Weak vs average vs elite teams (same match state)
- Result: Elite teams ~6-10 runs higher than weak teams
- Finding: Team aggregates have measurable but moderate impact

**C. Opposition Bowling Impact**
- Tested: Weak vs strong bowling attacks
- Result: Elite bowling reduces scores by 7-11 runs
- Finding: Opposition features work and have meaningful impact

**Status:** ✅ Complete - All fantasy features functional

---

### 5. Documentation ✅

**Files Created:**
- `README.md` - Complete project documentation
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - This file
- `results/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - Detailed validation analysis
- `data/feature_summary.txt` - Dataset statistics

**Status:** ✅ Complete

## 📊 Performance Analysis

### Meeting Targets

| Target | Goal | Achieved | Status |
|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Overall R² | 0.75 | 0.69 | ⚠️ Close (92%) |
| MAE | <25 runs | 24.93 | ✅ Met |
| Pre-match R² | 0.30-0.45 | 0.35 | ✅ Met |
| Late R² | 0.92-0.95 | 0.94 | ✅ Met |
| Test cases | 500-1000 | 2,904 | ✅ Exceeded |

### Why Overall R² is 0.69 (not 0.75)

**Reasons:**
1. Pre-match inherent uncertainty (R² = 0.35 drags average down)
2. Mix of international and domestic matches in training
3. Moderate impact of team composition features (match state dominates)
4. Some players missing from database (51% coverage)

**Still acceptable because:**
- Close to target (92% of 0.75)
- Late-stage performance excellent (R² = 0.94)
- 70% accuracy within ±30 runs
- Progressive improvement clearly demonstrated

---

## 🎯 Strengths & Limitations

### Strengths ✅

1. **Progressive accuracy:** Clear improvement from 0.35 to 0.94
2. **Late-stage excellence:** R² = 0.94 at death overs
3. **Well-validated:** 2,904 real test cases
4. **Fantasy features work:** Opposition bowling impact measurable
5. **Production-ready backend:** Model can be loaded and used

### Limitations ⚠️

1. **Pre-match uncertainty:** R² = 0.35 (inherent limitation)
2. **Player impact small:** Individual batsmen 1-3 runs (match state dominates)
3. **Overall R² below target:** 0.69 vs 0.75 (but close)
4. **No frontend:** Backend only, needs UI
5. **Venue coverage:** Unknown venues may affect accuracy

---

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

### How It Currently Works

```
1. User prepares input:
   - Match state (score, wickets, overs)
   - Team composition (11 players → aggregates)
   - Opposition (11 bowlers → aggregates)
   - Venue (historical average)
   - Current batsmen (if mid-match)

2. Load model:
   model = pickle.load('models/progressive_model_full_features.pkl')

3. Create DataFrame:
   scenario = pd.DataFrame([{...}])

4. Predict:
   prediction = model.predict(scenario)[0]

5. Result:
   "Predicted final score: 320 runs"
```

### What's Missing

```
1. User opens web interface ❌
2. Selects 11 players from dropdown ❌
3. Sets match scenario ❌
4. Clicks "Predict" ❌
5. Sees prediction with visualization ❌
6. Tests what-if scenarios ❌
```

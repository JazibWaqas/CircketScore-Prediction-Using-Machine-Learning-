# ODI PROGRESSIVE PREDICTOR - COMPLETE PROJECT STATUS

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** Model trained, R² = 0.85, needs real-match validation

---

## 🎯 PROJECT IDEA

**Title:** "Progressive ODI Cricket Score Prediction with Fantasy Team Building"

**What it does:**
- Predicts ODI final score at ANY match stage (0 to 50 overs)
- Enables fantasy cricket: users select 11 players, test different compositions
- What-if analysis: "What if Kohli batted instead of Rahul?"

**Innovation:**
- Progressive prediction (pre-match to late-match in one model)
- Team composition analysis (fantasy cricket capability)
- Player swap testing

**Use case:**
- Fantasy cricket team builder
- Match scenario simulator
- Strategic decision support

## 📊 CURRENT RESULTS (From BUILD_AND_TRAIN.py)

### Dataset Created:
- **Source:** 5,761 ODI matches from `raw_data/odis_ballbyBall/`
- **Samples:** 68,470 total (15 checkpoints per match)
- **Training:** 54,776 samples
- **Test:** 13,694 samples (20% random split)

### Model Performance:
```
Overall:          R² = 0.8497 (85%), MAE = 16.75 runs

By Stage:
  Pre-match (0-10)    R² = 0.6790, MAE = 28.29 runs
  Early (10-20)       R² = 0.8737, MAE = 17.09 runs  
  Middle (20-30)      R² = 0.9132, MAE = 13.87 runs
  Late (30-40)        R² = 0.9457, MAE = 10.53 runs
  Death (40+)         R² = 0.9659, MAE = 7.83 runs

Accuracy:
  Within ±10 runs: 48.7%
  Within ±20 runs: 71.9%
  Within ±30 runs: 84.3%
```

**Assessment:** GOOD! Functional model with respectable metrics.

## 🔧 WHAT WAS BUILT

### Files in ODI_Progressive/:

**Main Scripts:**
1. `BUILD_AND_TRAIN.py` (349 lines) - **COMPLETE**
   - Parses all ODI matches from raw_data
   - Creates ball-by-ball dataset with 15 checkpoints per match
   - Trains XGBoost pipeline
   - Evaluates and saves results
   - **Status:** ✅ Working, produces R² = 0.85

2. `TEST_ON_REAL_MATCHES.py` - **NEEDS FIXING**
   - Tests on 2024-2025 recent matches
   - Validates model on unseen data
   - **Status:** ⚠️ Path issues, needs to run

3. `QUICK_TEST_WHATIF.py` - **READY**
   - Tests team composition what-if
   - Verifies fantasy features work

**Old Scripts (can ignore):**
- `scripts/1_build_progressive_dataset.py` - Alternative approach (not used)
- `scripts/2_train_progressive_model.py` - Alternative (not used)
- Others - experimental (not used)

### Data/Models:

**Created (nested path issue):**
- `ODI_Progressive/models/odi_progressive_pipe.pkl` - Trained model
- `ODI_Progressive/results/training_results.txt` - Results summary

**Should be (correct paths):**
- `models/odi_progressive_pipe.pkl`
- `results/training_results.txt`

**Issue:** BUILD_AND_TRAIN created nested ODI_Progressive/ODI_Progressive/ folders

## 🎯 APPROACH (How It Works)

### Based on Cricket-Score-Predictor (Proven R²=0.98 for T20)

**What we copied (methodology):**
- ✅ Ball-by-ball parsing from JSON
- ✅ Cumulative score calculation
- ✅ Rolling window for momentum (last 60 balls)
- ✅ Pipeline: OneHot → Scale → XGBoost
- ✅ Simple effective features

**What we adapted:**
- 🎯 ODI (300 balls) instead of T20 (120 balls)
- 🎯 Added team_batting_avg (our innovation for fantasy)
- 🎯 Multiple checkpoints (progressive prediction)
- 🎯 Used OUR data (raw_data/odis_ballbyBall/)

### Features (8 total):
1. `current_score` - Runs scored so far
2. `balls_left` - Balls remaining  
3. `wickets_left` - Wickets remaining
4. `crr` - Current run rate
5. `last_10_overs` - Runs in last 60 balls
6. `team_batting_avg` - Team quality (OUR ADDITION)
7. `batting_team` - Team name (one-hot encoded)
8. `city` - Venue (one-hot encoded)

**Target:** `final_score`

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES

### Issue 1: Nested Folder Structure
- Model saved to: `ODI_Progressive/ODI_Progressive/models/`
- Should be: `ODI_Progressive/models/`
- **Fix:** Either move file or update BUILD_AND_TRAIN.py paths

### Issue 2: Random Split (Not Temporal)
- Used random train/test split
- NOT tested on truly unseen future matches
- Could be overfitting like before
- **Fix:** Need to test on real 2024-2025 matches separately

### Issue 3: Validation Not Complete
- Need to run TEST_ON_REAL_MATCHES.py
- Verify R² holds on recent unseen matches
- **Critical:** This is how we caught the fake R²=0.69 before!

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Fix Model Location
Either:
- **Option A:** Move `ODI_Progressive/ODI_Progressive/models/odi_progressive_pipe.pkl` → `ODI_Progressive/models/`
- **Option B:** Update TEST scripts to use correct nested path
- **Option C:** Re-run BUILD_AND_TRAIN.py with fixed paths (already fixed in code)

### Step 2: Validate on Real Matches
```bash
cd ODI_Progressive
python TEST_ON_REAL_MATCHES.py
```

**This will show if R² = 0.85 is REAL or FAKE!**

### Step 3: Test What-If
```bash
python QUICK_TEST_WHATIF.py
```

Verify team composition affects predictions.

### Step 4: If All Pass
- ✅ Project is COMPLETE and FUNCTIONAL
- ✅ R² = 0.85 is legitimate
- ✅ Fantasy features work
- ✅ Ready for course submission

## 📁 DATA SOURCES (What We Actually Used)

**Used (OUR data):**
- ✅ `raw_data/odis_ballbyBall/` - 5,761 ODI match JSONs
- ✅ `ODI/data/CURRENT_player_database_977_quality.json` - Player stats (977 players)
- ✅ Parsed fresh, created NEW dataset

**Not used:**
- ❌ Cricket-Score-Predictor data (only used as methodology reference)
- ❌ Cricket-Player-Performance data (flawed, ignored)
- ❌ Any pre-built datasets

**The dataset IS new, built from YOUR raw data!**

---

## 🎓 FOR COURSE GRADING

### Current Metrics:
- Overall R² = 0.85 (good!)
- Late-stage R² = 0.97 (excellent!)
- Progressive improvement shown

### Expected Grade: **A- or A**

**If R² holds up on real 2024-2025 matches:**
- ✅ Project is legitimate
- ✅ Submit with confidence

**If R² drops significantly on real matches:**
- ⚠️ Overfitting issue (like before)
- Need to fix with temporal split

---

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

1. ✅ Model trains successfully (68K samples, 5 min)
2. ✅ R² = 0.85 overall (functional)
3. ✅ Late-stage R² = 0.97 (excellent)
4. ✅ Pre-match R² = 0.68 (enables fantasy, much better than 0.27!)
5. ✅ Model saved and loadable
6. ✅ Based on proven working approach

## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS VERIFICATION

1. ⚠️ Test on REAL unseen 2024-2025 matches
2. ⚠️ Verify fantasy features (team_batting_avg) actually affect predictions
3. ⚠️ Confirm not overfitted like previous attempts

## 🎯 PROJECT GOAL RECAP

**For course:**
- Need good metrics (R² > 0.80) ✅ Have 0.85
- Need functional system ✅ Model works
- Need some novelty ✓ Progressive + fantasy

**For fantasy:**
- Users select 11 players → calculates team_batting_avg
- Users set match scenario (overs, score, wickets)
- Model predicts final score
- Users swap players → prediction updates

**Ready to proceed once validation confirms R² is real!**

## 🔄 TO RESUME WORK

When restarting:
1. Check if TEST_ON_REAL_MATCHES.py ran successfully
2. Look at R² on 2024-2025 matches  
3. If R² ~0.80-0.85: ✅ Project complete!
4. If R² < 0.50: ❌ Overfitted, need temporal split
5. Then test QUICK_TEST_WHATIF.py for fantasy features
6. If both pass: PROJECT COMPLETE ✅
